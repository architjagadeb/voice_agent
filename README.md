# Day 1 - 30 Days of AI Voice Agents Challenge 🚀

Welcome to Day 1 of the **30 Days of AI Voice Agents Challenge by Murf AI**!  
This project sets the foundation for building intelligent voice-driven applications by establishing a working backend and frontend setup.

## 📌 Task Overview

**Day 1 Goal:**  
> Set up a Python backend using Flask and serve a basic HTML + JavaScript frontend from it.

## ✅ What I Built

- ✅ Served a styled `index.html` page directly from the backend
- ✅ Linked a `script.js` file to demonstrate frontend interaction via JavaScript
- ✅ Tested the full integration (backend → frontend → browser interaction)
