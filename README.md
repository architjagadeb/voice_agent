# 30 Days of AI Voice Agents Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my journey through the **30 Days of AI Voice Agents Challenge by Murf AI**!  
This project explores the development of intelligent voice-driven applications — from backend setup to real-time voice generation — using Python, Flask, and the Murf TTS SDK.

> 🛠 This repository is a living project and will be updated regularly as each day's challenge is completed.

## 📌 Challenge Overview

This challenge is hosted by **Murf AI** in collaboration with **Voice of Learning** and spans 30 days of hands-on voice tech exploration.  
Each task involves building a specific feature or integration for an AI-powered voice agent using Murf’s tools.

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 🎯 Task 1 – Flask Backend + Frontend Setup
- ✅ Initialized a minimal Flask server (`app.py`)
- ✅ Served `index.html` from the backend
- ✅ Connected a `script.js` file for frontend interaction
- ✅ Verified everything renders and runs correctly in browser

### 🎯 Task 2 – Text-to-Speech Integration (Murf SDK)
- ✅ Created a REST `/tts` endpoint using Flask
- ✅ Integrated Murf’s Python SDK and `text_to_speech.generate()` method
- ✅ Secured API key using `.env` file
- ✅ Tested the API using Postman
- ✅ Built a basic HTML audio player to preview generated voice output
- ✅ Organized project assets for Day 1 and Day 2 into structured folders

## 🧠 Reflections

Each task builds on the last — and these early days gave me hands-on exposure to:
- Backend fundamentals with Flask
- Serving static files and connecting frontend/backend
- Using Murf's Python SDK to generate realistic audio
- Sending and testing HTTP requests via Postman
- Designing clean UI to display outputs interactively
